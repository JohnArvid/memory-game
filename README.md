# memory-game
An old memory game I originally wrote with jquery. Now refactored to vanilla js and cleaner design.

## Learnings
- Running into some interesting thing when factoring out jquery
- Working with font-awesome
- The power of making things more modular... even if it's all one js file.


### Things to do
- 

- Fixed: Factor out functionality into more modular functions.
- Fixed: Use simple icons/symbols as "pictures" instead of nonexistent jpgs
- Fixed: Use proper event delegation.
- Fixed: Bug when new game.
- Fixed: handle different numberOfCards (16, 36)
- Fixed: implement ui for selecting number of cards to play
- Fixed: adjust css to handle different number of cards, everything should be relatively sized
