# memory-game
An old memory game I wrote with jquery. Now refactored to vanilla js and a little cleaner look.
Things to do
- Factor out functionality inte more modular functions.
- Use simple icons/symbols as "pictures" instead of nonexistent jpgs
- Use proper event delegation.
- More responsive UI.
