# memory-game
An old memory game I originally wrote with jquery. Now refactored to vanilla js and a little cleaner look.

## Learnings
- Running into some interesting thing when factoring out jquery
- Working with font-awesome
- The power of making things more modular...


### Things to do
- Fixed: Factor out functionality inte more modular functions.
- Fixed: Use simple icons/symbols as "pictures" instead of nonexistent jpgs
- Fixed: Use proper event delegation.
- Fixed: Bug when new game.
- More responsive UI. This really needs to happen...
