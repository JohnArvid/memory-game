# memory-game
An old memory game I originally wrote with jquery. Now refactored to vanilla js and a little cleaner look.

## [Play it here](https://johnarvid.github.io/memory-game/)

## Learnings
- Running into some interesting thing when factoring out jquery
- Working with font-awesome
- The power of making things more modular...


### Things to do
- handle different numberOfCards (16, 20, 25, 30, 36)
- implement ui for selecting number of cards to play
- adjust css to handle different number of cards, everything should be relatively sized

- Fixed: Factor out functionality inte more modular functions.
- Fixed: Use simple icons/symbols as "pictures" instead of nonexistent jpgs
- Fixed: Use proper event delegation.
- Fixed: Bug when new game.
