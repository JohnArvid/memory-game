# memory-game
An old memory game I wrote with jquery. Now refactored to vanilla js and a little cleaner look.

## [Play it here](https://johnarvid.github.io/memory-game/)

### Things to do
- Fixed: Factor out functionality inte more modular functions.
- Fixed: Use simple icons/symbols as "pictures" instead of nonexistent jpgs
- Fixed: Use proper event delegation.
- Bug when new game.
- More responsive UI.
