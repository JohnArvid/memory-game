# memory-game
An old memory game I wrote with jquery. Now refactored to vanilla js and a little cleaner look.
Things to do
- Fixed: Factor out functionality inte more modular functions.
- Fixed: Use simple icons/symbols as "pictures" instead of nonexistent jpgs
- Fixed: Use proper event delegation.
- More responsive UI.
